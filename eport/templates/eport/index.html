            <p>Hello my name is <strong>John Juvi Q. De Villa</strong> and I am a <strong>programmer</strong> and <strong>Film Editor</strong>.</p>
            <p>
              I have been programming for <strong>4 years</strong> and have made a number of projects since then.
              I first learned about Java but was unable to create a working app with it since I was relatively new to programming.
              After then switched to <strong>Python</strong> so I can learn about AI and machine learning.
              I was able to learn the basic fundamentals in building a neural network but due to lack of proper online resources,
              I ended up stopping midway to learn something easier in my age.
              I then started learning basic <strong>web design</strong> to create some of the projects down below.
              In the process, I learned <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong>, and <strong>CSS</strong>. For my backend I used my knowledge and experience in Python.
              After learning Web design, I switched to <strong>mobile development</strong> in the android platform. Rather than using Java, I used
              <strong>C#</strong> so I can use the <strong>.NET</strong> and <strong>Xamarin</strong> Framework so I can easily create and IOS app when the time comes to grow.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div data-animate="fadeInUp" class="col-lg-6">
            I also enjoy making videos and trying <strong>VFX editing</strong> in my spare time. I use <strong>Hitfilm Pr</strong> in most of my videos
            since it's easier to use and less resource-intensive than the Adobe products.
            Other than Hitfilm, I also use the <strong>Mocha</strong> plugin to do my <strong>3D tracking</strong> and <strong>Rotoscoping</strong>.
            From time to time I also use <strong>Adobe After Effects</strong> for animations and advance VFX editing.

              Having created 2 websites, I can say that I am somewhat experienced in web design.
              While I may still be a rookie and still need to learn a lot more things before I become exceptionally good at it,
              I still think that as an 18 year old student I did well. I hope to learn and experience new things in the future
              and see where my knowledge and experience in Web Development takes me.

              This is still quite new for me. I just recently started on creating a mobile app but hopefully like for Web Development, it becomes useful
              and helpful for my future career. I hope to be creating lots more things in mobile and be able to incorporate advance technologies to it
              such as Artificial Intelligence.

              I still have a long road to walk before I can be considered as a <strong>pro</strong> in Filming and editing. While in reality, all I lacked is more experience
              and projects but seeing how this is mostly a hobby and something I can use in conjunction with my programming skills. Though this may be the case, I still hope
              that this may be useful for my future tech careers.

                        <p>During the pandemic, me and my family had a hard time financially. We decided to buy local goods such as vegetables and seafood every Saturday then sell them off in our subdivision. At first we had to rely on Facebook groups created by the Avida Sta. Catalina Village to post our products. This made it hard and tedious to update and respond to order messages. Because of this, I decided to create a website for us to use for free.</p>
                        <p>I desgined this website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. For my backend, the server-side, I used Python since it's the language I'm currently used to before starting web development. I also made use of bootstrap to make styling easier since it gives you CSS classes that you can easily use.</p>
                        <p>I added basic functions for our website such as displaying the products that are available and their prices. I also implemented an account system so the users can log in and order. With this we won't be using messenger to manage orders since Messenger wasn't really built for that.</p>

                        <p>In Grade 11, Ms. Kit assigned us to create a teaser for the upcoming awards night. At first we had a hard time coming up with a good concept but we had an inspiration in mind. A youtuber, named BenTK, makes cool looking videos with amzing transitions. This became our groundwork on what kind of teaser we would want to create.</p>
                        <p>Our concept was simple. Our main character has a vision of going and enrolling in Statefields School. In this vision he got to see and experience the wonders and joys of film making with his groupmates.</p>
                        <p>This certainly took a while to make. I wouldn't have done it without the help of my groupmates and those who help in creating this video. I also had fun editing this and would even go as far as to call it one of my greatest works so far. </p>

                        <p>Creating this Online Tool was just something that inspired me after seeing the app Notion. While it may seem senseless and tiring for some by creating a tool that you won't know if it'll work or not, not for me. Knowing that I might be the only person who'll get affected if my program goes wrong is good enough. If anything, it serves as an inspiration for me to do well and perfect it as fast as possible.</p>
                        <p>I had my fair share of troubles when creating this web app. It was hard since I had to code the logic and mechanics of note taking from scratch. I also learned in creating basic databases using Django, a python framework used as a backed for websites. In the end it was fun and I certainly hope that one day this gets finished and that I'd be able to share it to other people.</p>

                        <p>I was invited by Ms. Jay-Ann to particpate in this MOS world competition. I was honestly intrigued and wanted to try it out. I chose MS Excel since I've dabbled into it when I was designing a registrar system using the MS Excel software. The MOS World competition is a world wide event organized by Certiport. A representative would be chosen for each country and would participate on the upcoming National Competitions in California, USA.</p>
                        <p>I decided to participate in the training program conducted there for 4 weeks. After that, we took the certification program needed before we can actually participate in the following competitions that will decide the representative of the country. I manage to pass with high scores and chosen to take the next upcoming competitions.</p>
                        <p>Sadly due to the Pandemic, the events and competition got cancelled and my goal of going to California for free ended.</p>

                        <p>Making this was quite the hassle. I literally didn't sleep at night just to finish editing the scenes and animations. This had that much priority since it was for the grade in both Oral Com and DRRR. </p>
                        <p>In the end it turned out well. I enjoyed adding that additional earthquake ground cracking vfx. I seriously wouldn't want to stress over filming like in here ever again.</p>

                        <p>When me and my team decided on making a todo list app back in winter break, I went online to find a good UI designer for free. I stumbled into Figma which is a really cool web app and it even has its own desktop app. Not only that but it's also capable in sharing the prototype and layout with other people. We can also collaborate and work on the design at the same time.</p>
                        <p>With this we were able to create the layout of our app within a week. After finalizing the layout, features and design, I then went ahead and started coding the app in Visual Studio 2019 using a Xamarin Framework.</p>

                        <p>This was one of the last projects I had before the pandemic started. We had a great time making this video for our chemistry PT. With the help of my groupmates I was able to finish this video with relative ease.</p>
                        <p>Now it's quite obvious how bad I am in animating and I just couldn't help it since I lacked the necessary practice and time to give it my all. This might probably be the extent of my skills as an editor unless I give the time to hone this skill I got.</p>
